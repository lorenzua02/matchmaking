# Lollo's matchmaking algorithm
Provide player's names and mmr and generate mathematically balanced teams

# How to use
- Fill the input.json file with your friend's data: everyone need to have their mmr
- Open the generate_teams.py and see the result

The team score is the sum of all his components' mmr; the program will show the team that has the lowest difference (a.k.a. the most balanced team)

TIP: After a game softly edit players' mmr depending on their in-game performance
